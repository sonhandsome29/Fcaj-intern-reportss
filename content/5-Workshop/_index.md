# Deploying the Project Management Dashboard to AWS

#### Overview

This workshop explains how to deploy the **Project Management Dashboard** from a local development environment to AWS using a 3-tier architecture:

+ **Frontend**: Next.js deployed with **AWS Amplify**
+ **Backend**: Node.js/Express running on **AWS EC2**
+ **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on **AWS RDS**

The system also uses:

+ **AWS API Gateway** to expose a public HTTPS endpoint for the frontend
+ **AWS S3** to store images and static files
+ **AWS Cognito** to manage sign-in, sign-up, and authentication tokens
+ **AWS Lambda Trigger** to synchronize newly confirmed Cognito users into the application database
