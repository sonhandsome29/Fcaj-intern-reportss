### Deploying the Backend on Amazon EC2

In this section, we deploy the Node.js/Express backend to **Amazon EC2** so it can serve API requests for the frontend. The EC2 instance is placed in a public subnet for easier administration, while the database remains in private subnets for better security.

EC2 is a good fit for this project because:

* **Full control over the environment**: easy to install Node.js, Prisma, PM2, and project dependencies
* **Low cost**: `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` can be used within Free Tier limits
* **Easy integration**: the backend can connect privately to RDS and sit behind API Gateway for HTTPS access
